# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤—

Iâ€™m **Bedo**, a software developer currently working remotely for [lexgo.cl](https://lexgo.cl), a legaltech company. I have founded ventures like [agrapp.cl](https://agrapp.cl) and occasionally I develop ideas to test new products. I am passionate about technology and solving complex problems.

I am an alumnus of programs such as **StartupChile**, **ChileVentures**, and **500 Startups**. Additionally, I make annual trips to the United States to visit friends at tech companies.

If you want to learn more about my work or just chat, you can contact me at [i@bedomax.com](mailto:i@bedomax.com) or visit my personal website and blog at [bedomax.com](https://bedomax.com).

Thank you for visiting my profile!
